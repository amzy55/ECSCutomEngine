# My First Custom Engine

</div>

The engine follows a Data Oriented Design - Entity Component System using the [EnTT library](https://github.com/skypjack/entt).

After creating the baseline architecture of the engine, I created an **Ability System** for a top-down combat game, inspired by [Brawl Stars](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/).

This project includes elements from the Bee engine @[BUas](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames).
